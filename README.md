# Born2Move
This program was made as part of an assignment. In a nutshell, it gives the user a list of exercise options.  
These exercises can be chosen by the user, or randomly picked out. Once the user is done they can rate the exercise. The list of exercises can be sorted according to it's score using one of several sorting algorithms. These algorithms were also implemented as part of the assignment.  
Finally, using ASP.NET, a browser interface was built for this application.
